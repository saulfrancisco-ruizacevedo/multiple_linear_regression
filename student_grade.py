'''
Regression model to predict a student's final grade based on the five attributes.

Description of the Parameters:

Study Hours: The number of hours a student studies each week.
Attendance (%): The percentage of classes attended by the student.
Extracurricular Activities: The count of extracurricular activities the student participates in.
Parental Involvement: A scale from 1 to 5 indicating the level of parental involvement in the student's education (1 = low, 5 = high).
Age: The age of the student.
Final Grade (%): The final grade percentage achieved by the student.
